# Data Sources 
The main source of data is the official CoVid source in Spain: cnecovid.es

* https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/#documentaci%C3%B3n-y-datos

The CSV data used is:
* https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/resources/casos_tecnica_ccaa.csv

I consolidated data by date the total number of cases by using Open
Office Calc sheet that you can found in data/ folder named
"casos_tecnica_ccaa.ods" based on previous information.

The consolidated source used in the project is:
"casos_tecnica_ccaa_totales_fecha.csv".
